            <span id="gold">Rolex Gold</span> now, lets turn our attention from demand to the supply side of the market. 
            Whiles demand analyzes the market from the perspective of consumers, supply focuses on producers and sellers 
            of the commodity. Like quantity demanded, the quantity of milk to be supplied by dairy farmers is not a fixed
            number, but depends on the many factors. Of these factors, price plays a central role. After that we will bring
            on board the other determinants (variables) that influence supply. Supply of a commodity is the various quantities
            of the commodity that sellers or producers are willing and able to offer for sale at the various price levels within
            a time. The law of supply asserts that, ceteris paribus (other things equal), the higher the price, the more the quantity 
            supplied and vice versa. Thus there is a direct or positive relationship between price and quantity supplied.For exchange 
            or transaction to take place, there should be market. A market is an institution or mechanism that brings buyers (demanders)
            and sellers (suppliers) of a particular good or service together.Non economists are apt to think of consumerâ€™s demand as a 
            fixed amount.

    <span id="glow">Rolex Glow</span> A demand schedule is a table that shows the inverse relationship between quantities
    demanded of a commodity at selected price. If the table is for a particular person, it is termed as an individual 
    demand schedule. A market demand schedule, however, sums up all the individual demand schedules for a particular 
    commodity horizontally. Now, let's turn our. attention from demand to the supply side of the market. Whiles demand 
    analyzes the market from the perspective of consumers, supply focuses on producers and sellers of the commodity. Like 
    quantity demanded, the quantity of milk to be supplied by dairy farmers is not a fixed number, but depends on the many 
    factors. Of these factors, price plays a central role.Our analysis will, first of all, focus on the relationship between
    price and quantity supplied. After that we will bring on board the other determinants (variables) that influence supply. 
    Supply of a commodity is the various quantities of the commodity that sellers or producers are willing and able to offer 
    for sale at the various price levels within a time.
